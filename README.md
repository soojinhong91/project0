# Tic Tac Toe

This is my first project from Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, Sydney.

All the skills that have been taught in class for last two weeks have been applied to build this game from scratch.

## Initial Approach
1. Built basic HTML & CSS structure
    : Semantic markup & grid, flex-box
2. Wrote JavaScript with jQuery
    : for loop & if conditions
3. Added more Events and CSS
